Grocery Store Sales Analysis

Project Description: The project involves analyzing sales data in a grocery store across different countries, considering sales volumes, revenue, customer gender, and age. The data was analyzed and visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, and pivot tables were used to derive key metrics. Finally, an interactive dashboard was created in Tableau to display key indicators.

Project Goal: The main goal of the project was to explore and analyze sales in a grocery store to understand key factors influencing customers' product choices and revenue generation. This provided valuable insights for optimizing sales strategies, improving marketing effectiveness, and refining product assortments.

Conclusions: The analysis of grocery store data has revealed several key findings. Firstly, we identified the most profitable product categories, including frozen products, beauty care items, and bakery and breakfast products. Additionally, we found the most profitable item to be Ashai Lager Beer. The most popular banks among customers include BDO Unibank, Philippine Veterans Bank, Philippine National Bank, Enterprise Bank, and ING Bank. Furthermore, we established that our customers do not have a strong preference for any specific payment method.
