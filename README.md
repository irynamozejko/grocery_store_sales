The data was analyzed and visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, and pivot tables were used to derive key metrics. Finally, an interactive dashboard was created in Tableau to display key indicators.

Project Goal: The main goal of the project was to explore and analyze sales in a grocery store to understand key factors influencing customers' product choices and revenue generation. This provided valuable insights for optimizing sales strategies, improving marketing effectiveness, and refining product assortments.
